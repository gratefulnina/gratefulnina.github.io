								<h3>About me</h3>
								<p>Thank you for coming on to my page! I'm Nina Nam. I won $80,000 cash as the grand prize winner of the Bodybuilding.com's Annual 12-week Transformation Challenge amongst 57,000+ contestants worldwide in 2015. My badass book/memoir about this journey is coming out the end of this year. It's about why I wanted to win so badly, how I maintained focus and faith, and some uenxpected obstacles and weird hacks! I wrote it primarily because I want the reader to feel fired up about something he/she wants, believe it is going to happen, and never never never give up. That miracle happened to me because of fierce faith in myself, and fierce focus. I'm into God, well-being, abundance, gratitude. I will share more videos and writing on strengthening our mental, physical, spiritual life for amazing health and happiness. I'm a group fitness instructor for Equinox in Los Angeles. I currently teach an insane cardiokickboxing class (while holding light dumbbells OH SHIET)! Subscribe to get updates on my books, events, and workout classes. You'll be the first to know when my book is out. Free pdfs. Email me to try a sweat-drenching class with me for free!</p>

							<H3>Excerpt from my book!</H3>
							<div class="container">
							<div><em>Every adversity, every failure, and every heartache carries with it the seed of an equivalent or greater benefit.</em></div>
							<p style="text-align:right">—from <i>Think and Grow Rich<i> by Napoleon Hill</p>
							</div>
							</center>

							<p class="tab">I don’t even like lifting weights, running, and almost everything I did to win the 2015 Bodybuilding.com Transformation Challenge. I only did it because I wanted the money, the looks, and the recognition, initially. So, I did every planned workout and ate every planned morsel, pill, and powder for three consecutive months, no matter how I was feeling. It was the hardest thing I’d ever done in my life. I didn’t break any rules or go off-plan, ever. This miracle was possible for two reasons: FAITH— I believed I had a real chance at winning, I trusted God, I knew deep in my heart that if I stayed committed, it would work out in my favor—and I stayed fiercely FOCUSED. My story is about the power of FAITH and FOCUS.</p>


							<p class="tab">Watch out because fierce FAITH and FOCUS will cause obsession—an obsession that, for me, resulted in a big win at a time in my life when I really needed it. At the time when I did the contest, I was living in a nice apartment that no one would guess was low-income housing, just a five-minute walk to the ocean in beautiful Santa Monica with organic stores everywhere, fancy dogs, and chiseled six-packs jogging on every other block. I had a decent car and nothing was stopping me from living a fulfilling life, that is nothing . . . but me.</p>


							<p class="tab">At that time in my life I felt like a real loser, a phony pretending to be doing OK. After ten years of half-assedly pursuing acting, I only had a handful of credits: three national commercials with my voice deleted out of all of them, a few print ads that I never got to see, and a split second of me saying, “Cheers!” in a big movie. </p>


							<p class="tab">I loved acting, but I didn’t have the thick skin and unstoppable fire for it. The endless rejections felt personal. I repeatedly told myself: “If I was prettier . . . ,” “If I was thinner . . . ,” or “If I was smarter or funnier, I would have gotten that gig.” I didn’t put in the necessary hundreds of hours of hard work to strengthen my acting, which would have built a foundation of confidence, or at least made me feel that I was good enough as a performer. Instead, I was hoping my acting dream would come easily, which led to me continuing to project my insecurities so that my self-worth continued shrinking.</p>


							<p class="tab">With negative thoughts come more negative thoughts. Every new “survival” job reinforced that I was a loser: making and delivering cheap sandwiches; cleaning off tables for celebrities at a high-end sushi restaurant; driving drunk people home at 3am on weekends (that includes providing a throw-up bag, helping them put their shoes back on, and carrying them to their doorstep—for women . . . for the guys, I’d just shove them out of my car, just kidding, not really); selling alcohol in a cheap tight dress with a high slit in the back as I stood in front of the whiskey section at ghetto Korean grocery stores (I made sure to wear stockings as thick as sweatpants. As an extra insurance against perverts, I wore a business suit jacket and my mom’s old dust-encrusted marshmallow nurse shoes, instead of the required sexy heels. As hard as I tried to avoid any Koreans I might know, I ran into my dad, my grandma on my dad’s side, my grandpa on my dad’s side, my aunt, my uncle, my cousins, an old friend, all at separate times, and each looked at me in horror-pity. “Relax, I’m not a prostitute . . . OK, almost not,” I’d assure them. Honestly though, they were flabbergasted by my bad choices in life). I’ve quit jobs on the first day of working, others after a few weeks of putting up with shiet; no matter what I guaranteed I was gone within several months of starting a job. No one was gonna domesticate this beast.</p>


							<p class="tab">An insensitive friend who’d been at her same unfulfilling job for more years than she was proud to admit, laughed in front of a group of mutual friends, “What job hasn’t Nina applied for?!” At least  I have the guts to leave a dumb job, I thought. But her words stung.</p>


							<p class="tab">I insanely resented working at lame survival jobs. But it was the only way I knew how to have a flexible schedule to attend auditions at any time of the day. The biggest blow to my ego was being a background extra on movie sets amongst dozens of weirdos and wannabes.</p>


							<p class="tab">I didn’t know what the heck to do. I went back to Berkeley twice when I had quarter-life crises, feeling like a failure who’s best bet was to finish a sorry degree in theatre arts that I’d started years earlier as an undergrad. But I couldn’t stand even a day of listening to an old fart professor complaining that Hollywood was racist, or cringing as I read what felt like thousands of pages about ancient theatrical acting in Greece. My heart kept taking me back to LA.</p>


							<p class="tab">My mom begged me to join the military, my aunt tried to bribe me into her family business, my sister yelled at me to get a real job, everybody and their neighbor had a better idea for my life than I did.</p>


							<p class="tab">I hated telling people I was pursuing acting so much that I eventually stopped talking about it. I wanted to be successful already, be a powerful actress, what I thought was a badass somebody. Definitely not a pathetic 30-year-old wannabe actress.</p>


							<p class="tab">I knew I was so much better than all this, but was I? Maybe I’m not that interesting. Maybe I’m not good enough to deserve the kind of life I want. I was definitely not thin enough according to two very successful talent managers who both rejected me. One of them was known for having a slew of up-and-coming hot young actors. The first thing she said was, “You look like you’re hiding something. Lift up your shirt and come closer to me.” I wasn’t trying to hide my belly! I just like baggy shirts! And I wasn’t interviewing to be some model, so what the heck? I sucked in my flab slightly, careful that she didn’t notice my effort.</p>


							<p class="tab">Intimidating like Judge Judy, she explained, “You’re competing with girls that are a size zero. Unless you want to be the fat funny girl. But you can’t be in-between. If you’re serious about acting, come back to me after you lose the weight. You’re cute, but you’re starting late.”</p>


							<p class="tab">I didn’t know how to respond. She called me sort-of fat, but at least she called me cute, but she also called me old, but at least she said I could come back, but that means she doesn’t think I’m good enough to work as an actress right now just because of the flab she saw only when I lifted my shirt?</p>


							<p class="tab">By the time I got in my car, I burst into a broken fire hydrant of tears. I shouldn’t have lifted my stupid shirt for her. I shouldn’t have let her talk to me like that. I should know how to stand up for myself, I should know what it feels like to be grounded and really true to myself. I should be better than this . . .</p>


							<p class="tab">Ten years of that voiceless-ness, not taking big risks, feeling gutless. I didn’t feel alive, I didn’t feel true to myself, I didn’t feel like I was doing anything right. I wasted so much of my life doing nothing. I was like a pissed-off hamster furiously spinning in my stupid wheel, angry that it was getting me nowhere. I was sick of being a nobody beggarly actress at the mercy of someone’s opinion of me. But mostly, I was angry at myself. Sometimes I felt a full-on rage, at this stupid, stupid life I created. (Two “stupids” for emphasis.) Full-on rage at this stupid wheel I’d stayed on for too long.</p>


							<p class="tab">So, when I came across Bodybuilding.com’s Transformation Challenge, I grabbed it and made it into the fight of my life—the fight for my life: I will to prove to myself that I have what it takes to be a success, that I know how to give it my all, that I am much more than this life I have lived so far. I want to be a new person. I will be a new person.</p>
